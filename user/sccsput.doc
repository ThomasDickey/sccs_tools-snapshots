<header>

USAGE

<paragraph>

<F31>sccsput<F32> [options] [file-specifications]

<header>

SYNOPSIS

<paragraph>

<F31>Sccsput<F0> is a simple, easy to use interface to <F32>sccs<F0> 
(<F31>s<F0>ource <F31>c<F0>ode <F31>c<F0>ontrol <F31>s<F0>ystem).  
For each file specified as input, it checks differences against the 
previously archived version and prompts you for change history comments.

<header>

DESCRIPTION

<paragraph>

<F31>Sccsput<F0> uses the <F32>sccs<F0> utilities <F31>admin<F0> 
and <F31>delta<F0> to maintain versions of a given source file in 
a dependent directory named <#7f>sccs".  It is more than an integration 
of the <F31>admin<F0> and <F31>delta<F0> utilities, however:

<bullet>

<F6>S<F0><Tab>It checks to ensure that each file is indeed a text 
file (so that you do not accidentally archive <#7f>.o" files, for 
example).

<F6>S<F0><Tab>If you give <F31>sccsput<F0> a directory name, it 
will recur, checking-in files in the directory.

<F6>S<F0><Tab>For each file which has a corresponding <#7f>s." file, <F31>scc
sput<F0> compares the two (using <F31>diff<F0>) and pipes the result 
through the pager.

<F6>S<F0><Tab>An option is provided so that you may direct <F31>sccsput<F0> 
to perform the differencing without checking the file into sccs.

<F6>S<F0><Tab>The <#7f>s." file is post-processed by <F31>sccsput<F0> 
so that the check-in date matches the file's modification date.

<paragraph>

The last point is the fundamental advantage offered by <F31>sccsput<F0>.  
The ordinary <F32>sccs<F0> methodology uses the current date as the 
check-in date.  This works well only for large projects in which a 
central project administrator is responsible for controlling the versions 
of source files.  It does not work well for small projects, for which <F32>sccs
<F0>'s primary advantage is its compact storage of multiple versions 
of a file.

By using the file's modification date as a reference, you can more 
easily 
<|,2>back up to a meaningful version <#1f> by date, rather than version 
number

<footnote>

<F6>!<F0><Tab>By working exclusively in terms of modification date, 
you lose the ability to specify sccs release numbers.  Given the complexity 
of <F32>sccs<F0>'s interface for release and version numbers, this 
is probably not such a great loss.

<F31>Sccsput<F0> integrates all of the functions used in the <F32>sccs<F0> 
check-in process into one utility program.

<header>

OPTIONS

<paragraph>

Some of the options which you may specify to <F31>sccsput<F0> are 
passed through to the underlying utilities.  Others represent extensions:

<options>

-<F31>b<F0><Tab>is passed to <F31>diff<F0>, and directs it to ignore 
trailing blanks on a line, and to treat repeated blanks as a single 
blank.

-<F31>c<F0><Tab>directs <F31>sccsput<F0> to use <F31>cat<F0> rather 
than the <F49>PAGER<F0> (usually <F31>more<F0>) to display differences.  
This is most useful in an Apollo pad, since the <F31>more<F0> program 
would otherwise switch to VT100 emulator mode.

-<F31>l<F0> <F32>file<F0><Tab>causes <F31>sccsput<F0> to generate 
a log-file of the files which are processed, and all differences which 
are encountered.  The log-file is inherited in recursion to lower 
directory levels (i.e., it is written to the same place).

-<F31>n<F0><Tab>instructs <F31>sccsput<F0> to test for differences, 
but not to check the files into <F32>sccs<F0>.

-<F31>s<F0><Tab>suppresses some of the messages generated by the <F32>sccs
<F0> <F31>delta<F0> utility describing the number of lines changed, 
etc.

<header>

OPERATIONS

<paragraph>

The <F31>sccsput<F0> utility is designed for use in small development 
projects.  The methodology for this tool follows:

<bullet>

<F6>S<F0><Tab>Develop source files <#7f>normally".  Each file should 
contain sccs keywords (see <F32>get<SP>(1)<F0>) so that you will 
be able to distinguish checked-out files.  The <F32>sccs<F0> keywords 
should appear at the top of your source file, for consistency.  In 
C language programs, the convention is to make a string which will 
permit the <F31>what<F0> utility to show the versions of the modules 
which make up a program:

<fixed>

#ifndef<Tab>lint<HR>
static<Tab>char<Tab>sccs_id[] = "@(#)sccsput.doc<Tab>1.1 88/05/05 
08:07:16";<HR>
#endif<Tab>lint

<bullet>

<|,3><F6>S<F0><Tab>Periodically archive (with <F31>sccsput<F0>) 
those versions of files which you wish to keep

differences should be the substituted <F32>sccs<F0> keywords.

<F6>S<F0><Tab>Build the released version of your program.  All files 
should be present.  No embedded path names should refer to your development 
copy.  To ensure good isolation, you may change the permissions on 
your development directory temporarily.

<paragraph>

<F31>Sccsput<F0> checks your source file out after the check-in, 
automatically.  This is done to facilitate development.  A check-in 
simply adds the latest changes to a file onto the archive.

When checking files into <F32>sccs<F0>, it is a good idea to make 
a test run (using the <#7f>-<F31>n<F0>" option) so that you can inspect 
the differences.  For example, you may have forgotten to remove (or 
bypass) debugging stubs.  Or, you may have been editing a checked-out 
file (with the <F32>sccs<F0> keywords substituted).  <F31>Sccsput<F0> 
would archive this anyway.  If you forget, and wish to kill the check-in, 
wait until the <#7f>comments?" prompt is issued by the <F31>delta<F0> 
utility.  At this point you may kill <F31>sccsput<F0> without having 
to clean up temporary files.

If you do not have write-permission on the <#7f>sccs" directory, but 
wish to review changes, use the <#7f>-<F31>n<F0>" option.  The intermediate 
files are written in the <F31>/tmp<F0> directory.

<header>

ENVIRONMENT

<paragraph>

<F31>Sccsput<F0> is a Bourne shell script.  On Apollo DOMAIN/IX, 
it uses System<SP>5 features including <F32>dirname<SP>(1)<F0> and <F32>getopt
<SP>(1)<F0>.

Environment variables imported by <F31>sccsput<F0> include:

<|,4><F31>Sccsput<F0> also uses the following environment variables:

<options>

<F49>NOTE<F0><Tab>Provides a default value for the delta comments.  
Normally you should provide case-by-case comments for each file.  
This variable is provided so that other programs can invoke <F31>sccsput<F0>.  
If the <F49>NOTE<F0> variable is defined (i.e., non-null) it is used; 
you will not be prompted for comments.

<F49>PAGER<F0><Tab>identifies the program to use in displaying differences 
between the file which is being checked in, and the previously archived 
version.  There may be a lot of differences <#1f> more than can be 
shown on one screen.

<F49@R>SCCS_DIR<F30@R><Tab>specifies the directory into which the <F32@R>sccs<F30@R> 
<#7f>s." files are stored.  If no specified, <F31@R>sccsput<F30@R> assumes 
<#7f>sccs".

<header>

FILES

<paragraph>

<F31>Sccsput<F0> uses the following files

<options>

<F49>sccsput<F0><Tab>the Bourne shell script

<F49@R>putdelta<F30@R><Tab>A utility which invokes <F31@R>admin<F30@R> or <F31@R>delta
<F30@R> as required, and modifies the sccs <#7f>s." file after check-in 
so that the check-in date matches the file's modification date.

<header>

ANTICIPATED CHANGES

<paragraph>

Make <F31>sccsput<F0> clean up temporary files if it is interrupted.

Provide a mechanism for inserting dummy version numbers so that <F31>sccsput
<F0> can bump the release number (for genuine major releases).  Currently, 
the SID's are restricted to 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.
