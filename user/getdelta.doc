<|,1>NAME

<paragraph>

<F31>getdelta<F0> <#1f> SCCS check-out utility

<header>

USAGE

<paragraph>

<F31>getdelta<F32> [options] [file-specifications]

<header>

SYNOPSIS

<paragraph>

<F31>Getdelta<F0> is a simple interface to <F32>sccs<F0> (<F31>s<F0>ource 
<F31>c<F0>ode <F31>c<F0>ontrol <F31>s<F0>ystem), which is used 
to extract files from <F32>sccs<F0> archives.

<header>

DESCRIPTION

<paragraph>

<F31>Getdelta<F0> checks out (extracts) files from an <F32>sccs<F0> 
archive which have been checked in using <F31>putdelta <F0>(or<F31> 
sccsput<F0>, which invokes it).  <F31>Putdelta<F0> checks in files, 
retaining their modification date as the check-in date. <F31> Getdelta<F0> 
extracts a given version of one or more files, and sets the modification 
date to match the check-in date.

<header>

OPTIONS

<paragraph>

<F31>Getdelta<F0> is a package (which invokes <F32>sccs<F0>'s <F31>get<F0>) 
which does special things with the file modification date.  Most of 
its options are passed to <F31>get<F0>, and then interpreted to determine 
the correct modification date:

<options>

-<F31>c<F0> <F32>cutoff<F0><Tab>specifies the <F32>sccs<F0> cutoff 
date, in the format

<Tab><Tab>YY[MM[DD[HH[MM[SS]]]]]

<Tab>Punctuation in the date is permitted.  For example,

<subfixed>

-c 77/2/2 9:22:25

-c 770202092225

<options>

<Tab>represent the same date.

-<F31>f<F0><Tab>forces <F31>getdelta<F0> to remove the current version 
of the file before extracting the specified version.  Otherwise, <F31>getdelta
<F0> will refuse to overwrite a file which already exists.

-<F31>k<F0><Tab>directs get to extract the specified file without 
substituting sccs identification keywords.  You should use this option 
if you intend to make updates to the file.

-<F31>n<F0><Tab>suppresses the <F31>get<F0>-operation.  Instead, <F31>getdelt
a<F0> echoes a message showing the name, version and date of files 
which would be extracted.

<|,2>-<F31>r<F0> <F32>SID<F0><Tab>specifies the <F32>sccs<F0> 
identification string (SID) of the version of an <F32>sccs<F0> file 
to be retrieved.

-<F31>s<F0><Tab>suppresses most messages written by the <F31>get<F0> 
utility (i.e., those written to standard output).

<header>

OPERATIONS

<paragraph>

To extract files using <F31>getdelta<F0>, you must provide one or 
more names.  They must be the names either of the working files, or 
of the archive <#7f>s." files.

<header>

ENVIRONMENT

<paragraph>

<F31>Getdelta<F0> invokes the <F32>sccs<F0> utility <F31>get<F0>, 
which must be in your path.  Environment variables used by <F31>getdelta<F0> 
include:

<options>

<F49>SCCS_DIR<F0><Tab>specifies the directory in which <F31>getdelta<F0> 
will find the <#7f>s." files.  If not specified, <F31>getdelta<F0> 
assumes <#7f>sccs".

<F49>TZ<F0><Tab>is the timezone, which <F31>getdelta<F0> manipulates 
to obtain the file's modification date.  It assumes that the timezone 
of the check-in date in the <#7f>s." file is <F49>EST5EDT<F0>.

<header>

FILES

<paragraph>

<F31>Getdelta<F0> consists of a single binary file written in C.  
It runs in a unix<F6>T<F0> environment.
