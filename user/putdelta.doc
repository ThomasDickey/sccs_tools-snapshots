<|,1>NAME

<paragraph>

<F35>putdelta<F0> <#1f> SCCS check-in utility

<header>

USAGE

<paragraph>

<F35>putdelta<F36> [options] [file-specifications]

<header>

SYNOPSIS

<paragraph>

<F35>Putdelta<F0> is a simple, easy to use interface to <F36>sccs<F0> 
(<F35>s<F0>ource <F35>c<F0>ode <F35>c<F0>ontrol <F35>s<F0>ystem).  
It checks into the <F36>sccs<F0> archive all files specified.

<header>

DESCRIPTION

<paragraph>

<F35>Putdelta<F0> uses the <F36>sccs<F0> utilities <F35>admin<F0> 
and <F35>delta<F0> to maintain versions of a given source file in 
a dependent directory named <#7f>sccs".  It is more than an integration 
of the <F35>admin<F0> and <F35>delta<F0> utilities, however:

<bullet>

<F6>S<F0><Tab>If the <F36>sccs<F0> archive directory does not already 
exist, <F35>putdelta<F0> creates it.

<bullet>

<F6>S<F0><Tab>If the file has not been locked, <F35>putdelta<F0> creates 
a lock (i.e., a <#7f>p." file)

<footnote>

<F6>!<F0><Tab>If a <#7f>p." file already exists, <F35>putdelta<F0> 
will attempt to use the lock.  However, if the lock belongs to another 
user, <F35>putdelta<F0> will not check-in the file.

<F6>!<F0>.

<bullet>

<F6>S<F0><Tab><F35>Putdelta<F0> retains the executable-mode of the 
file which is checked-in.  That is, if it is a shell-script (and has 
a mode such as 755), the mode of <F36>sccs<F0> <#7f>s." file is set 
to 555.  The <F35>getdelta<F0> utility works in the opposite fashion, 
setting the extracted file's mode to correspond to that of the <#7f>s." 
file.

<bullet>

<F6>S<F0><Tab><F35>Putdelta<F0> sets the <#7f>-n" option of delta, 
so that your file is not deleted after check-in.

<bullet>

<F6>S<F0><Tab>The <#7f>s." file is post-processed by <F35>putdelta<F0> 
so that the check-in date matches the file's modification date.

<paragraph>

The last point is the fundamental advantage offered by <F35>putdelta<F0>.  
The ordinary <F36>sccs<F0> methodology uses the current date as the 
check-in date.  This works well only for large projects in which a 
central project administrator is responsible for controlling the versions 
of source files.  It does not work well for small projects, for which <F36>sccs
<F0>'s primary advantage is its compact storage of multiple versions 
of a file.

<paragraph>

By using the file's modification date as a reference, you can more 
easily back up to a meaningful version <#1f> by date, rather than 
version number.

<paragraph>

<F35>Putdelta<F0> integrates the essential functions used in the <F36>sccs
<F0> check-in process into one utility program.

<header>

<|,2>OPTIONS

<paragraph>

The options which you may specify to <F35>putdelta<F0> are passed 
through to the underlying <F35>admin<F0> and <F35>delta<F0> utilities:

<options>

-<F35>s<F0><Tab>suppresses some of the messages generated by the <F36>sccs
<F0> <F35>admin <F0>and <F35>delta<F0> utilities describing the number 
of lines changed, etc.

<options>

-<F35>y<F0> <F36>text<F0><Tab>specifies the change-history text.  
You will be prompted for this if you do not supply it, in versions 
after the first, by the <F35>delta<F0> utility.

<header>

OPERATIONS

<paragraph>

<F35>Putdelta<F0> is designed to operate with the standard <F35>sccs<F0> 
utilities with a minimum of fuss and bother.  It retains your working 
file after check-in since that facilitates development.  In effect, 
it simply appends the current version of each file which you specify 
onto the archive.

<header>

ENVIRONMENT

<paragraph>

Environment variables imported by <F35>putdelta<F0> include:

<options>

<F56>SCCS_DIR<F0><Tab>specifies the directory into which the <F36>sccs<F0> 
<#7f>s." files are stored.  If no specified, <F35>putdelta<F0> assumes 
<#7f>sccs".

<options>

<F56>TZ<F0><Tab>is the prevailing timezone, which <F35>putdelta<F0> 
uses to set the check-in date in the <#7f>s." file.  <F35>Putdelta<F0> 
sets the timezone to <F56>EST5EDT<F0>, in part to avoid conflict with <F35>get
<F0>'s date checking.

<header>

FILES

<paragraph>

<F35>Putdelta<F0> is a single binary file, written in C.  It runs 
in a unix<F6>T<F0> environment.

<header>

ANTICIPATED CHANGES

<paragraph>

Provide a mechanism for inserting dummy version numbers so that <F35>putdelta
<F0> can bump the release number (for genuine major releases).  Currently, 
the SID's are restricted to 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.
