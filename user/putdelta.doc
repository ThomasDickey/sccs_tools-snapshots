<|,1>NAME

<paragraph>

<F31>putdelta<F0> <#1f> SCCS check-in utility

<header>

USAGE

<paragraph>

<F31>putdelta<F32> [options] [file-specifications]

<header>

SYNOPSIS

<paragraph>

<F31>Putdelta<F0> is a simple, easy to use interface to <F32>sccs<F0> 
(<F31>s<F0>ource <F31>c<F0>ode <F31>c<F0>ontrol <F31>s<F0>ystem).  
It checks into the <F32>sccs<F0> archive all files specified.

<header>

DESCRIPTION

<paragraph>

<F31>Putdelta<F0> uses the <F32>sccs<F0> utilities <F31>admin<F0> 
and <F31>delta<F0> to maintain versions of a given source file in 
a dependent directory named <#7f>sccs".  It is more than an integration 
of the <F31>admin<F0> and <F31>delta<F0> utilities, however:

<bullet>

<F6>S<F0><Tab>If the <F32>sccs<F0> archive directory does not already 
exist, <F31>putdelta<F0> creates it.

<F6>S<F0><Tab>If the file has not been locked, <F31>putdelta<F0> 
creates a lock (i.e., a <#7f>p." file)

  ,512,102,1101,3,
<footnote>

<F6>!<F0><Tab>If a <#7f>p." file already exists, <F31>putdelta<F0> 
will attempt to use the lock.  However, if the lock belongs to another 
user, <F31>putdelta<F0> will not check-in the file.

<End Text>)

 (E10,0,0,0,1,1,0.053333,1,15,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0.066667,0.066667,6,6,0,0.066
  667,6))>
<F6>!<F0>.

<F6>S<F0><Tab><F31>Putdelta<F0> retains the executable-mode of 
the file which is checked-in.  That is, if it is a shell-script (and 
has a mode such as 755), the mode of <F32>sccs<F0> <#7f>s." file 
is set to 555.  The <F31>getdelta<F0> utility works in the opposite 
fashion, setting the extracted file's mode to correspond to that of 
the <#7f>s." file.

<F6>S<F0><Tab><F31>Putdelta<F0> sets the <#7f>-n" option of delta, 
so that your file is not deleted after check-in.

<F6>S<F0><Tab>The <#7f>s." file is post-processed by <F31>putdelta<F0> 
so that the check-in date matches the file's modification date.

<paragraph>

The last point is the fundamental advantage offered by <F31>putdelta<F0>.  
The ordinary <F32>sccs<F0> methodology uses the current date as the 
check-in date.  This works well only for large projects in which a 
central project administrator is responsible for controlling the versions 
of source files.  It does not work well for small projects, for which <F32>sccs
<F0>'s primary advantage is its compact storage of multiple versions 
of a file.

By using the file's modification date as a reference, you can more 
easily back up to a meaningful version <#1f> by date, rather than 
version number.

<|,2><F31>Putdelta<F0> integrates the essential functions used in 
the <F32>sccs<F0> check-in process into one utility program.

<header>

OPTIONS

<paragraph>

The options which you may specify to <F31>putdelta<F0> are passed 
through to the underlying <F31>admin<F0> and <F31>delta<F0> utilities:

<options>

-<F31>s<F0><Tab>suppresses some of the messages generated by the <F32>sccs
<F0> <F31>admin <F0>and <F31>delta<F0> utilities describing the 
number of lines changed, etc.

-<F31>y<F0> <F32>text<F0><Tab>specifies the change-history text.  
You will be prompted for this if you do not supply it, in versions 
after the first, by the <F31>delta<F0> utility.

<header>

OPERATIONS

<paragraph>

<F31>Putdelta<F0> is designed to operate with the standard <F31>sccs<F0> 
utilities with a minimum of fuss and bother.  It retains your working 
file after check-in since that facilitates development.  In effect, 
it simply appends the current version of each file which you specify 
onto the archive.

<header>

ENVIRONMENT

<paragraph>

Environment variables imported by <F31>putdelta<F0> include:

<options>

<F49>SCCS_DIR<F0><Tab>specifies the directory into which the <F32>sccs<F0> 
<#7f>s." files are stored.  If no specified, <F31>putdelta<F0> assumes 
<#7f>sccs".

<F49>TZ<F0><Tab>is the prevailing timezone, which <F31>putdelta<F0> 
uses to set the check-in date in the <#7f>s." file.  <F31>Putdelta<F0> 
sets the timezone to <F49>EST5EDT<F0>, in part to avoid conflict 
with <F31>get<F0>'s date checking.

<header>

FILES

<paragraph>

<F31>Putdelta<F0> is a single binary file, written in C.  It runs 
in a unix<F6>T<F0> environment.

<header>

ANTICIPATED CHANGES

<paragraph>

Provide a mechanism for inserting dummy version numbers so that <F31>putdelta
<F0> can bump the release number (for genuine major releases).  Currently, 
the SID's are restricted to 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.
