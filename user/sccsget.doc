<|,1>NAME

<paragraph>

<F31>sccsget<F0> <#1f> SCCS check-out script

<header>

USAGE

<paragraph>

<F31>sccsget<F32> [options] [file-specifications]

<header>

SYNOPSIS

<paragraph>

<F31>Sccsget<F0> is a simple interface to <F32>sccs<F0> (<F31>s<F0>ource 
<F31>c<F0>ode <F31>c<F0>ontrol <F31>s<F0>ystem), which is used 
to extract files from <F32>sccs<F0> archives.

<header>

DESCRIPTION

<paragraph>

<F31>Sccsget<F0> checks out (extracts) files from an <F32>sccs<F0> 
archive which have been checked in using <F31>sccsput<F0>.  <F31>Sccsput<F0> 
checks in files, retaining their modification date as the check-in 
date. <F31> Sccsget<F0> extracts a given version of one or more files, 
and sets their modification date to match the check-in date.

<header>

OPTIONS

<paragraph>

<F31>Sccsget<F0> is a directory-recursive interface to the <F31>get<F0> 
utility which does special things with the file modification date.  
Most of its options are passed to <F31>get<F0>, and then interpreted 
to determine the correct modification date:

<options>

-<F31>c<F0> <F32>cutoff<F0><Tab>specifies the <F32>sccs<F0> cutoff 
date, in the format

<Tab><Tab>YY[MM[DD[HH[MM[SS]]]]]

<Tab>Punctuation in the date is permitted.  For example,

<subfixed>

-c 77/2/2 9:22:25

<subfixed>

-c 770202092225

<options>

<Tab>represent the same date.

-<F31>f<F0><Tab>forces <F31>sccsget<F0> to remove the current version 
of the file before extracting the specified version.  Otherwise, <F31>sccsget
<F0> will refuse to overwrite a file which already exists.

-<F31>k<F0><Tab>directs get to extract the specified file without 
substituting sccs identification keywords.  You should use this option 
if you intend to make updates to the file.

-<F31>n<F0><Tab>suppresses the <F31>get<F0>-operation.  Instead, <F31>sccsget
<F0> echoes an <#7f>ok" message for files which would be extracted.

-<F31>r<F0> <F32>SID<F0><Tab>specifies the <F32>sccs<F0> identification 
string (SID) of the version of an <F32>sccs<F0> file to be retrieved.

<|,2>-<F31>s<F0><Tab>suppresses most messages written by the <F31>get<F0> 
utility (i.e., those written to standard output).

<header>

OPERATIONS

<paragraph>

To extract files using <F31>sccsget<F0>, you must provide one or 
more names.  They may be either file or directory names.

<F31>Sccsget<F0> resolves names until it finds one of the form <#7f>sccs/s.
<F32>file<F0>" before invoking <F31>get<F0>.  If it finds a directory 
(other than <#7f>sccs"), <F31>sccsget<F0> will recur on itself to 
extract files at lower levels.

<header>

ENVIRONMENT

<paragraph>

<F31>Sccsget<F0> is a Bourne shell script.  On Apollo DOMAIN/IX, 
it uses System<SP>5 features, including <F32>getopt<SP>(1)<F0>.  
Environment variables used by sccsget include:

<options>

<F49>RUNLIB<F0><Tab>identifies the execution path of this tool, and 
of subordinate components (e.g., <F31>sccsdate<F0>).<Tab>

<F49>TZ<F0><Tab>is the unix time zone, which is overridden internally 
so that file modification dates are independent of the local time 
zone.

<header>

FILES

<paragraph>

Sccsget uses the following files:

<options>

<F49>sccsget<F0><Tab>the Bourne shell script<Tab>

<F49>sccsdate<F0><Tab>a utility which modifies the file's modification 
date after check-out so that the file's modification date matches 
the version-date selected with the <#7f>-<F31>c<F0>" or <#7f>-<F31>r<F0>" 
option.
