<|,1>NAME

<paragraph>

<F35>sccsget<F0> <#1f> SCCS check-out script

<header>

USAGE

<paragraph>

<F35>sccsget<F36> [options] [file-specifications]

<header>

SYNOPSIS

<paragraph>

<F35>Sccsget<F0> is a simple interface to <F36>sccs<F0> (<F35>s<F0>ource <F35>c
<F0>ode <F35>c<F0>ontrol <F35>s<F0>ystem), which is used to extract 
files from <F36>sccs<F0> archives.

<header>

DESCRIPTION

<paragraph>

<F35>Sccsget<F0> checks out (extracts) files from an <F36>sccs<F0> 
archive which have been checked in using <F35>sccsput<F0>.  <F35>Sccsput<F0> 
checks in files, retaining their modification date as the check-in 
date. <F35> Sccsget<F0> extracts a given version of one or more files, 
and sets their modification date to match the check-in date.

<header>

OPTIONS

<paragraph>

<F35>Sccsget<F0> is a directory-recursive interface <F34@R>to the <F35@R>getdel
ta<F34@R> utility<F0> (which invokes <F36>sccs<F0>'s <F35>get<F0>) 
which does special things with the file modification date.  Most of 
its options are passed to <F35>get<F0>, and then interpreted to determine 
the correct modification date:

<options>

-<F35>c<F0> <F36>cutoff<F0><Tab>specifies the <F36>sccs<F0> cutoff 
date, in the format

<options>

<Tab><Tab>YY[MM[DD[HH[MM[SS]]]]]

<options>

<Tab>Punctuation in the date is permitted.  For example,

<subfixed>

-c 77/2/2 9:22:25

<subfixed>

-c 770202092225

<options>

<Tab>represent the same date.

<options>

-<F35>f<F0><Tab>forces <F35>sccsget<F0> to remove the current version 
of the file before extracting the specified version.  Otherwise, <F35>sccsget
<F0> will refuse to overwrite a file which already exists.

<options>

-<F35>k<F0><Tab>directs get to extract the specified file without 
substituting sccs identification keywords.  You should use this option 
if you intend to make updates to the file.

<options>

-<F35>n<F0><Tab>suppresses the <F35>get<F0>-operation.  Instead, <F35>sccsget
<F0> echoes an <#7f>ok" message for files which would be extracted.

<options>

-<F35>r<F0> <F36>SID<F0><Tab>specifies the <F36>sccs<F0> identification 
string (SID) of the version of an <F36>sccs<F0> file to be retrieved.

<options>

<|,2>-<F35>s<F0><Tab>suppresses most messages written by the <F35>get<F0> 
utility (i.e., those written to standard output).

<header>

OPERATIONS

<paragraph>

To extract files using <F35>sccsget<F0>, you must provide one or more 
names.  They may be either file or directory names.

<paragraph>

<F35>Sccsget<F0> resolves names until it finds one of the form <#7f>sccs/s.
<F36>file<F0>" before invoking <F35>get<F0>.  If it finds a directory 
(other than <#7f>sccs"), <F35>sccsget<F0> will recur on itself to 
extract files at lower levels.

<header>

ENVIRONMENT

<paragraph>

<F35>Sccsget<F0> is a Bourne shell script.  On Apollo DOMAIN/IX, it 
uses System<SP>5 features, including <F36>getopt<SP>(1)<F0>.  Environment 
variables used by <F35>sccsget<F0> include:

<options>

<F56@R>SCCS_DIR<F34@R><Tab>specifies the directory in which <F35@R>getdelta
<F34@R> will find the <#7f>s." files.  If not specified, <F35@R>getdelta<F34@R> 
assumes <#7f>sccs".

<header>

FILES

<paragraph>

Sccsget uses the following files:

<options>

<F56>sccsget<F0><Tab>the Bourne shell script

<options>

<F56@R>getdelta<F34@R><Tab>a utility which invokes <F35@R>get<F34@R>, 
and then modifies the file's modification date after check-out so 
that the file's modification date matches the version-date selected 
with the <#7f>-<F35@R>c<F34@R>" or <#7f>-<F35@R>r<F34@R>" option.
