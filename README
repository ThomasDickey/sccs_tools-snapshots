SCCS_TOOLS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module consists of the following programs (or scripts):

	getdelta
	putdelta
	sccsget
	sccsput
	sccs2rcs

To build the system from sources, do the following:

	(1) Adjust the top-level makefile, if necessary, to reflect the
	    installation-path (INSTALL_PATH) of these programs

Make the system by typing

	make all

This will build all binary programs into staging directories (bin) below
the src-directory, then install them into the top-level bin-directory.

You may build the binary programs into the staging directories alone,
and run tests by typing

	cd src
	make all
	make run_tests

When you are satisfied that the individual programs are ready for
installation, type (from this directory)

	make install

That will first copy from the staging directories, then from the top-level
bin-directory to the $(INSTALL_PATH) directory.
